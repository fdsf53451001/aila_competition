For instance, terminating an account solely due to 'extended periods of inactivity' might not be justifiable unless Faraday can demonstrate a legitimate interest (Article 6) and has informed users about this possibility. Additionally, Faraday should clearly define what constitutes 'fraudulent or illegal activities' and ensure that any actions taken are proportionate and respect the user's rights."
