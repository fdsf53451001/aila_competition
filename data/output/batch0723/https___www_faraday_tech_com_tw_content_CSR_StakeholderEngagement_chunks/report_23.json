While it's generally acceptable to limit liability, the clause should not contradict the GDPR's core principles.  Specifically, the clause should not waive liability in cases of unlawful data processing or for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.  Consider adding language that clarifies Faraday remains liable for breaches of its obligations under the GDPR and for damages directly caused by its negligence or intentional misconduct."}]}
