"amend": "While linking to third-party services is not prohibited, this section absolves CyberTAN of any responsibility for data processing by these third parties. Under GDPR, CyberTAN needs to ensure that any third-party data processors they work with also comply with GDPR regulations. This includes having appropriate contractual agreements in place that outline data protection responsibilities. CyberTAN should also provide users with clear and accessible information about the third-party services they link to, including the purpose of data processing and any potential risks."

"amend": "Similar to the previous point about third-party services, this section attempts to waive CyberTAN's responsibility for data processing by linked platforms. GDPR requires data controllers to be accountable for the data they process, even when shared with third parties. CyberTAN should clearly define its role and the role of these platforms (e.g., as joint controllers or processors) and outline the purpose of data sharing. They should also implement appropriate safeguards, such as data processing agreements, to ensure GDPR compliance by these third parties."

"amend": "While it's acceptable to amend the privacy statement, GDPR requires that any material changes be communicated to users in a clear and concise manner. Simply stating that the statement may be amended is not sufficient. The policy should specify how users will be informed about changes, such as through email notifications or prominent notices on the website. It should also be clarified whether users have the right to object to these changes and what options they have if they disagree."
