If the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to you, you have certain legal rights and these are set out in the section on Access to your Personal Information. At the time of collecting your Personal Information, we will inform you of:
our contact details;
the purpose for the collection and the legal basis for doing so;
if applicable, our legitimate interests for collecting your Personal Information;
any third parties or the categories of the third parties who will receive your Personal Information;
transfer of Personal Information to any country or organization outside EU, and the appropriate safeguards we apply when doing so, and where you can have access to such safeguards;
the criteria we use to determine the period for which your Personal Information will be stored;
your right to request access to, rectification, erasure of Personal Information or restrictions or objections to processing;
your right to withdraw your consent any time if you provide Personal Information based on your consent;
your right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in EU member state;
whether you are obliged to provide the Personal Information, and the possible consequences of failure to provide such information; and
whether we process any automated decision-making, including profiling based on the Personal Information you provide.
However, if you have already previously been informed of the above information, we may not provide further notification of the same.
Under GDPR, if your Personal Information is submitted to us from a party other than yourself, in addition to the above information, we will inform you of the categories of Personal Information concerned and where we obtained your information within reasonable period after obtaining the information. However, if you are already aware of the same, or we are required by law to obtain the information, or the provision of such information to you will involve disproportionate efforts to achieve, we will not provide you with the above details.
