The specific legitimate interests pursued need to be identified and explained, and there must be a balance test against the individual's rights and freedoms.\n*   **Unreasonably repetitive requests that require; disproportionate technical efforts and resources, for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing the current practices;**\n    While the GDPR allows for refusing manifestly unfounded or excessive requests, this needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The policy should mention the possibility of charging a reasonable fee or refusing the request only in specific, justified situations.\n*   **Potentially risks on the privacy of others.**\n    This needs to be more specific. The policy should explain what kind of risks to whose privacy would justify a restriction and how those risks outweigh the individual's rights."
