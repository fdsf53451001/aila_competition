"amend": "The exclusive jurisdiction of a court in Taiwan and the application of Taiwanese law, without regard to conflict of law provisions, may infringe on the rights of data subjects under the GDPR, particularly those residing in the EU.  \n\nThe GDPR emphasizes the data subject's right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in their own Member State (Article 77) and their right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor (Article 79).  \n\nTo comply with the GDPR, the choice of law clause should not prevent the application of GDPR provisions intended to protect individuals' rights and freedoms in relation to the processing of their personal data. Additionally, the choice of forum clause should allow data subjects residing in the EU to bring legal action in their own Member State. \n\nConsider adding a statement that clarifies the application of the GDPR for EU residents and their right to bring legal action in their own Member State."
